# Create-a-Data-Model-for-Seven-Sages
A data model and Power BI report for Seven Sages Brewing Company that combines information from all over the company to help the company's CFO to quickly review and analyze what beers sell well and which ones generate the highest profitability.

Seven Sages’ beers are sold in both Washington State and British Columbia, so there’s a currency consideration as well. Also, the company runs on a fiscal calendar. All this was  considered while building out the model.

### Main Steps
1.	Get the source files provided by SSBC.
2.	Sketch the data model to build.
3.	Load the data from the starter materials into Power BI.
4.	Structure, combine, and clean the data so that it works well in the data model.
5.	Create a date table to support time intelligence.
6.	Build a relationship from each dimension to the relevant key on the fact table.
7.	Write measures to calculate Sales, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit Margin in two different currencies.
8.	Create a report. Build a basic visual report to display your findings.
